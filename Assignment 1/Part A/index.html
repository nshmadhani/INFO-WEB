            <h2>Bitcoin</h2>    
        </div>
        <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent
            from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.Transactions are
            verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a
            blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name
            Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source
            software.</p>

            <h2>Ethereum</h2>    
        </div>
        <p>Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Additional founders of Ethereum included Gavin
            Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin. In 2014, development work commenced and was
            crowdfunded, and the network went live on 30 July 2015. The platform allows anyone to deploy permanent and
            immutable decentralized applications onto it, with which users can interact. Decentralized finance (DeFi)
            applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial
            intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks, such as allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against
            their holdings or lend them out for interest. Ethereum also allows for the creation and exchange of NFTs,
            which are non-interchangeable tokens connected to digital works of art or other real-world items and sold as
            unique digital property. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies operate as ERC-20 tokens on top of the
            Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin offerings.</p>

            <h2>Solana</h2>    
        </div>
    
        <p>Solana is a public blockchain platform. Its native cryptocurrency is SOL.
            Solana achieves consensus using a proof-of-stake mechanism, as well as a "proof-of-history" mechanism which
            Solana's whitepaper claims improves scalability without sacrificing decentralization and security. In 2021,
            Bloomberg journalist Joanna Ossinger described Solana as "a potential long-term rival for Ethereum", citing
            superior transaction speeds and lower associated costs.</p>

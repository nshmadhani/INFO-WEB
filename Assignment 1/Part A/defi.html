                Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers financial instruments without relying on intermediaries such as
                brokerages, exchanges, or banks. Instead, it uses smart contracts on a blockchain. DeFi platforms allow
                people to lend or borrow funds from others, speculate on price movements on assets using derivatives,
                trade cryptocurrencies, insure against risks, and earn interest in savings-like accounts.DeFi uses a
                layered architecture and highly composable building blocks. Some applications promote high interest
                rates but are subject to high risk. As of October 2021, the value of assets used in decentralized
                finance amounted to $100 billion.
            </p>
            <p>DeFi revolves around decentralized applications, also known as DApps, that perform financial functions on
                distributed ledgers called blockchains, a technology that was made popular by Bitcoin and has since been
                adapted more broadly. Rather than transactions being made through a centralized intermediary such
                as a cryptocurrency exchange or a traditional securities exchange, transactions are directly made
                between participants, mediated by smart contract programs. These smart contracts, or DeFi protocols,
                typically run using open-source software that is built and maintained by a community of developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                DApps are typically accessed through a browser extension or application. For example, MetaMask allows
                users to directly interact with Ethereum through a digital wallet. Many of these DApps can be
                linked to create complex financial services. For example, stablecoin holders can lend assets like USD
                Coin or Dai to a liquidity pool in a borrow/lending protocol like Aave, and allow others to borrow those
                digital assets by depositing their own collateral.[18] The protocol automatically adjusts interest rates
                based on the demand for the asset. Some DApps source external (off-chain) data, such as the price of
                an asset, through blockchain oracles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, Aave introduced "flash loans", which are uncollateralized loans of an arbitrary amount
                that are taken out and provably paid back within a single blockchain transaction.While there can be
                legitimate uses for flash loans such as arbitrage, collateral swap, self-liquidation, and unwinding
                leveraged positions, many exploits of DeFi platforms have used flash loans to manipulate cryptocurrency
                spot prices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another DeFi protocol is Uniswap, which is a decentralized exchange (DEX) set up to trade tokens issued
                on Ethereum. Rather than using a centralized exchange to fill orders, Uniswap pays users to form
                liquidity pools in exchange for a percentage of the fees that traders earn by swapping tokens in and out
                of the liquidity pools. Because no centralized party runs Uniswap (the platform is governed by its
                users), and any development team can use the open-source software, there is no entity to check the
                identities of the people using the platform and meet KYC/AML regulations. It is not clear what position
                regulators will take on the legality of such platforms.</p>
